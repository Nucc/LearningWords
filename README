Learning Words
==============

I created this application to learn english words on my iPod.

You can upload new words with touchpad and it will play with you Who wants to be a
millionare like game. You have one question (word in your langauge) and
four other words (in the foreign language) to choose. If you choose wrong, it
displays red background, otherwise you get a green field.

The software needs license from Apple to install to your iPhone, so you can play
with it in simulator only.
